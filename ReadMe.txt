How to make it work:

1. Create a separate directory and download SCN_release_v1.zip from http://deepscn.com/software.php.

2. Extract SCN_release_v1.zip to obtain the following 4 files: 
   * SCN.m  (Main file for building SCN models)
   * Tools.m (Supportive functions for SCN)
   * Demo_Regression.m
   * Demo_Classification.m
   Make sure the file names have not been changed.

3. For the toy experiments, run Demo_Regression.m and Demo_Classification.m in Matlab (to check that everything works fine, they have be tested on the 2016b and 2017a versions of Matlab).

4. For your own applications, make sure you have enough RAM and Disk to support the computation on your computing device.

5. The demos can be modified with new datasets. You can also change the parameters and the configurations for the SCN model in the code.
